Introduction to the Angular Docs
Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

These Angular docs help you learn and use the Angular framework and development platform, from your first application to optimizing complex single-page apps for enterprises. Tutorials and guides include downloadable examples to accelerate your projects.


Assumptions
These docs assume that you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some of the tools from the latest standards, such as classes and modules. The code samples are written using TypeScript. Most Angular code can be written with just the latest JavaScript, using types for dependency injection, and using decorators for metadata.
